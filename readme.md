Setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for C++ coding with input and output files on macOS can be done with the following steps. In this setup, we'll be using the Code Runner extension to run your C++ code with input from "input.txt" and save the output to "output.txt."





1. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install the C/C++ Extension**:
   To enable C++ development in VSCode, you should install the official C/C++ extension. Open VSCode, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar, and search for "C/C++." Install the one published by Microsoft.

3. **Create a C++ Project** (Optional):
   You can create a new folder for your C++ project or navigate to an existing one. Open VSCode from within the project folder. To create a new folder, you can use the terminal or the VSCode GUI.

4. **Install Code Runner Extension**:
   To run your C++ code with input from "input.txt" and save the output to "output.txt," you need to install the Code Runner extension. Open the Extensions view again, search for "Code Runner," and install it. 

5. **Configure Code Runner**:
   After installing Code Runner, you need to configure it to run C++ programs with input and output files.

   a. Open the VSCode settings by clicking on the gear icon in the lower-left corner, and then click on "Settings." Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd + ,`.

   b. In the search bar at the top, type "code runner run in terminal" and check the box that says "Whether to run code in the terminal."

   c. Now, search for "code runner executor map" and click "Edit in settings.json." This will open the `settings.json` file for Code Runner.

   d. Add the following configuration for C++ code with input and output files:

   ```json
   "code-runner.executorMap": {
       "cpp": "cd $dir && g++ $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt < input.txt > output.txt"
   }
   ```

   This configuration tells Code Runner to compile and run your C++ code using the input from "input.txt" and save the output to "output.txt."

6. **Create input.txt and output.txt**:
   In your project folder, create two text files: "input.txt" and "output.txt." You can use these files to provide input to your C++ program and capture the output.

7. **Write Your C++ Code**:
   Write your C++ code in a `.cpp` file within the project folder. You can use the integrated VSCode editor for this.

8. **Running Your Code**:
   Open the C++ file you want to run in VSCode and press `Ctrl + Option + N` (or use the `Code Runner` button in the top right corner of your editor) to run your code. Code Runner will compile and execute your program using the input from "input.txt" and save the output in "output.txt."

Remember to save your C++ file and the "input.txt" file before running the code to ensure the most recent changes are used.

Now, you have a VSCode setup for C++ coding with input and output files on macOS using the Code Runner extension.
